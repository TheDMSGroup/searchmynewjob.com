                    <h2>Costs of Signing Up for SearchMyNewJob™ Text
                    Messages</h2><br>
                    SearchMyNewJob™ does not charge you for its text message
                    program. But message and data rates may apply, so depending
                    on your plan with your wireless or other applicable
                    provider, you may be charged by your carrier or other
                    applicable provider.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Frequency of Text Messages</strong><br>
                    We may send you an initial message confirming that we have
                    received your optin. After that, you will receive recurring
                    text messages, and the specific amount may vary depending
                    on how you use our services.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The number of text messages you receive may depend upon
                    factors including how you use our services and whether you
                    take steps to generate additional text messages from us
                    (such as by sending a HELP request).
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2>Delivery of Text Messages</h2><br>

                    in the range of transmission sire, or if sufficient network
                    capacity is not available at a particular time. Even within
                    a coverage area, factors beyond the control of the wireless
                    carrier may interfere with message delivery, including the
                    customers equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings,
                    foliage, and weather. The wireless carrier does not
                    guarantee that alerts will be delivered and will not be
                    liable for delayed or undelivered messages.
